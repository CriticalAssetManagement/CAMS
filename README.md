## Critical Asset Management and Disaster Resilience for Cities, Communities and Nations.

While many cities, communities and nations seek to improve their disaster resilience by identifying their critical assets, their efforts often suffer from one or more of  problems. CAMS is a simple, free software tool that:

* Enables cities and islands to fully inventory their critical assets and assemble key data about them;
* Identifies the risks to which each asset is exposed;
* Maps the relationships between assets, both spatial and dependency-based;
* Helps to identify potential “failure chains” between them and the risks involved;
* Provides this output to other tools – emergency control room systems for example, or risk analysis tools.

The tool is being developed through a voluntary effort led by [ARISE-US](https://www.ariseglobalnetwork.org/), a private sector advisory group to the UN Disaster Risk Reduction (UN DRR) organization, and [TerminusDB](https://github.com/terminusdb). It will provide a baseline level of functionality to allow progressive, innovative communities and nations to improve their resilience.
