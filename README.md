## CAMS Objective
Enable islands, cities, and communities to effectively plan for disasters so they can rebuild faster and save lives in the event and aftermath of natural and man-made catastrophes.

Develop and deliver a mobile and desktop application that users can securely access to learn more about their critical assets and the potential failure chains associated with each. The application will:

- Build an inventory of all critical assets and the relevant data associated with them, for example, geographical coordinates. 
- Capture key contact information for assets – This could include multiple people for a power plant, through to a school caretaker who may have the keys to the school and need to be contacted to open it up as a place of shelter.
- Capture data on disaster severity and impact. These can range from cybersecurity threats to natural disasters and each has differing levels of criteria in terms of impact.
- Plot relationships, spatial and dependency, between critical assets to identify failure chains.
- Provide the ability to highlight the impact on critical assets and their failure chains based on the severity and type of disaster.
